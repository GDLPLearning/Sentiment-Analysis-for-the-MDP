# Sentiment analysis in Twitter for the Medellin Development Plan

This project was developed in the sixth cohort of the DSA4 Colombia program sponsored by MINTIC and led by Correlation One.



## Project description

### Business problem and solution approach

The Medellin Development Plan (MDP) 2020 - 2023 is the local government proposal that
seeks to guarantee comprehensive attention to the needs of Medellin’s citizens, care for vulnerable populations, economic reactivation, the construction of a sustainable city and the generation of opportunities based on a major educational transformation.
In other words, it is a promise of public policies by the mayor’s office in order to improve the
welfare of the people they represent by trying to meet the needs that afflict them. But are these
in tune with the proposals presented in the city’s development plan?. This is what this project
will try to answer, for which it will divide the analysis into two components:

1. Is the MDP aligned with the expressed by the population?

• In this first component, the main problems expressed by the inhabitants of Medellin
prior to the entry into force of the MDP will be identified and it will check if these
are part of the development plan.
• To solve this question a text analysis of information extracted will be performed from
Twitter (needs) and MDP (proposals) to check if there is any relationship between
them.

2. What is the perception of citizens in relation to MDP programs and projects during the
government’s term?

• The response of the citizens of Medellin in relation to this topic will be analyzed
through a sentiment analysis based on the perception exposed by the inhabitants on
Twitter in relation to these projects and programs of the MDP.

### Business Impact

Through the citizen’s perception of the MDP programs, as well as the needs felt by the population
on Twitter, it is possible to establish an alternative measurement of the assertiveness of the
current local government plan and likewise to open up the possibility of configuring a more
appropriate action horizon for future development plans for Medellin aligned with the above.
