    "The Medellín Development Plan (MDP) 2020 - 2023 is the local government proposal that seeks to guarantee comprehensive attention to the needs of Medellín's citizens, care for vulnerable populations, economic reactivation, the construction of a sustainable city and the generation of opportunities based on a major educational transformation.\n",

But are these in tune with the proposals presented in the city's development plan? This is what this project will try to answer, for which it will divide the analysis into two components:\n",
    "1. Is the MDP aligned with the needs expressed by the population?\n",
    "    - In this first component, the main problems expressed by the inhabitants of Medellin prior to the entry into force of the MDP will be identified and it will check if these are part of the development plan.\n",
    "    - To solve this question a text analysis of information extracted will be performed from Twitter (needs) and MDP (proposals) to check if there is any relationship between them.\n",
    "2. What is the perception of citizens in relation to MDP programs and projects during the government's term?\n",
    "    - The response of the citizens of Medellin in relation to this topic will be analyzed through a sentiment analysis based on the perception exposed by the inhabitants on Twitter in relation to these projects and programs of the MDP.\n"
