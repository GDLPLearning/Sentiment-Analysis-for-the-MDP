## Introduction

This section of the project contains supplementary material, it is suggested that the user read them in the prescribed order to deepen 
the information that is not covered in the report, the datafolio, presentation and dashboard. 

These workbooks and the project are inspired by the *Fundamental Methodology for Data Science* proposed by **John B. Rollins**, where through 
a sequence of steps, not always sequential, he describes the importance of initially defining a good understanding of the business problem 
and defining the analytical approach before moving fully to the data, after which the required information, as well as its collection, 
understanding and preparation come into the picture. Finally, the modeling, its evaluation, implementation and feedback give value to the 
project and anchor the principles of continuous improvement and sustainability.

The project notebooks are classified into two groups: `exploratory` and `reports`. The first group (*exploratory*) corresponds to initial 
explorations of each of the stages; they do not present very elaborate ideas or detailed descriptions of the visualizations. Despite this, 
they serve as input to refine the key ideas of the project and provide feedback on each of the steps of the methodology so that the information 
to be conveyed is clear, concise and useful.  

The second group (*reports*) is characterized by having an orderly structure of the content so that the user can replicate the project from beginning 
to end, including theoretical material that serves to give context to the code and visualizations, as well as the inclusion of previously selected 
graphics from the `exploratory notebooks` section, which add value to the analysis, the notebooks generated in this section could be considered as an 
appendix to the project report. 

Each of the groups can be differentiated by the folder in which they are located, and contain the following naming convention for each of the files: 
`group/number-section.ipynb` .The number corresponds to the recommended order in which to read the notebooks and the section is a descriptive name associated 
with the steps of the methodology previously described.
