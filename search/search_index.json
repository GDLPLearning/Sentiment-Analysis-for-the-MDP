Project description Business problem and solution approach The Medellin Development Plan (MDP) 2020 - 2023 is the local government proposal that seeks to guarantee comprehensive attention to the needs of Medellin\u2019s citizens, care for vulnerable populations, economic reactivation, the construction of a sustainable city and the generation of opportunities based on a major educational transformation. In other words, it is a promise of public policies by the mayor\u2019s office in order to improve the welfare of the people they represent by trying to meet the needs that afflict them. But are these in tune with the proposals presented in the city\u2019s development plan?. This is what this project will try to answer, for which it will divide the analysis into two components: Is the MDP aligned with the expressed by the population? \u2022 In this first component, the main problems expressed by the inhabitants of Medellin prior to the entry into force of the MDP will be identified and it will check if these are part of the development plan. \u2022 To solve this question a text analysis of information extracted will be performed from Twitter (needs) and MDP (proposals) to check if there is any relationship between them. What is the perception of citizens in relation to MDP programs and projects during the government\u2019s term? \u2022 The response of the citizens of Medellin in relation to this topic will be analyzed through a sentiment analysis based on the perception exposed by the inhabitants on Twitter in relation to these projects and programs of the MDP. Business Impact Through the citizen\u2019s perception of the MDP programs, as well as the needs felt by the population on Twitter, it is possible to establish an alternative measurement of the assertiveness of the current local government plan and likewise to open up the possibility of configuring a more appropriate action horizon for future development plans for Medellin aligned with the above.

These workbooks and the project are inspired by the Fundamental Methodology for Data Science proposed by John B. Rollins , where through a sequence of steps, not always sequential, he describes the importance of initially defining a good understanding of the business problem and defining the analytical approach before moving fully to the data, after which the required information, as well as its collection, understanding and preparation come into the picture. Finally, the modeling, its evaluation, implementation and feedback give value to the project and anchor the principles of continuous improvement and sustainability. The project notebooks are classified into two groups: exploratory and reports . The first group ( exploratory ) corresponds to initial explorations of each of the stages; they do not present very elaborate ideas or detailed descriptions of the visualizations. Despite this, they serve as input to refine the key ideas of the project and provide feedback on each of the steps of the methodology so that the information to be conveyed is clear, concise and useful. The second group ( reports ) is characterized by having an orderly structure of the content so that the user can replicate the project from beginning to end, including theoretical material that serves to give context to the code and visualizations, as well as the inclusion of previously selected graphics from the exploratory notebooks section, which add value to the analysis, the notebooks generated in this section could be considered as an appendix to the project report.

For this reason, we have a repository in github where you will be able to know all the structure of the project and complementary material. Get the repository There are two easy ways to download the entire contents of the repository, just do one of the two: Create a directory where you want to save the project, after that, enter the following link Sentiment-Analysis-for-the-MDP On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository, and click the code button and then Download ZIP . Set the path where you want to place the proyect, Open Git Bash there and then enter the following lines of code: mkdir folder_project_name # You can give any name to your folder # Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory. cd folder_project_name git clone https://github.com/GDLPLearning/Sentiment-Analysis-for-the-MDP.git Create your virtual environment To avoid incompatibilities between libraries and future errors when executing the project, we recommend isolating your work environment by creating a virtual environment, in this section we will use Anaconda, however, if you master another way to create virtual environments (e.g. venv ) feel free to do so. Download the Anaconda installer at the following link Anaconda , once you have you have chosen the distribution that fits your operating system or your preference. Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the recommended installation process. Open the anaconda prompt. Make sure you have the latest version of conda installed with the command conda update conda . To view the list of available python versions type the command conda search \u201c^python$\u201d . To create the virtual environment type conda create -n envname python=x.x anaconda and replace envname with the name that you want to assign to your environment and replace x.x with the version of python you want to use, we recommend using python 3.8 version or lower than 3.9 python=3.8.13 . To see the list of all the available environments use command conda info -e . To activate the virtual environment, enter the given command and replace your given environment name with envname conda activate envname . Once the environment is activated, go to the path where you downloaded the project and set the path there. The repository contains a text file requirements.txt containing all the packages and libraries as well as their versions necessary for the proper execution of the project. To install them type pip install -r requirements.txt . If your virtual environment is enabled you can install additional packages using pip install package or conda install package replace package with the name of the package to install. To close the virtual environment type conda deactivate . Remember to re-activate it every time you want to interact with the project. If you no longer require a virtual environment. Delete it using the following command and replace your environment name with envname conda remove -n envname -all . Enjoy it! After downloading all the project materials and having your virtual environment ready, it's time to enjoy it. We provide multiple resources to be able to understand, replicate and extend the project at your own pace, here is a list of the main elements you have at your disposal: Presentation: Approximately 10-minute video covering the most important points of the project, presented in a visually attractive way and suitable for all audiences. Datafolio: PDF file containing a summary of the entire project, at a glance you can learn about the key points of the project and its methodology. Report : PDF file with a larger extension containing the report derived from the whole project development, the problem, the data sets, the exploratory analysis, the model and more are contained here, it contains visualizations and technical details. Codebase: Python files organized in folders describing each section of the project can be used to replicate the project, as a basis for extending it or for developing your own projects. Notebooks: Jupyter notebook files inspired by Fundamental Methodology for Data Science proposed by John B. Rollins, each of them includes theory, code and visualizations to follow the project step by step. Dashboard: Application built in Dash that allows the user to interact with the visualizations generated throughout the project, while reviewing the key points in a more interactive way. Documentation: Documentation built in Read The Docs using Mkdocs, contains comments on all sections of the project so that the user understands the technical details of the libraries, modules and packages used.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"user-guide/getting-started/#get-the-repository","text":"There are two easy ways to download the entire contents of the repository, just do one of the two: Create a directory where you want to save the project, after that, enter the following link Sentiment-Analysis-for-the-MDP On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository, and click the code button and then Download ZIP .
